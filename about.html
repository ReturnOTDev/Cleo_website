            Cleo Henry is a 26 year old artist based in Cape Town, South
            Africa.<br />
            Her body of work is influenced mainly by her surroundings and her
            personal experiences throughout her life. Her primary mediums are
            pencil and fine liner.Capturing the face is a big part of her body
            of work and remains to be her most favourite art practice.
            Currently, she is a student at Vega, a school that focuses on brand
            leadership. She has previously studied at the Michaelis School of
            Fine Art and also possesses her diploma in make up artistry. What
            she is aiming for in her future is creating something that will
            empower free thinkers in South Africa.

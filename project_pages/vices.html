                I am a 25 year old woman, whose life on Earth has been lived
                surrounded by chaos and turmoil. Most of which was
                self-inflicted. I am a girl who was dealt a bad yet equally good
                and damn interesting deck of cards.
                <br /><br />
                When I was a kid, I was told all the usual things adults tell
                you. Stay in school, don’t do drugs, don’t smoke cigarettes and
                believe in God. For a good time I believed in these things. But
                there were certain things that happened in my life that resulted
                in me becoming obstinate to this advice. My mother and father
                had a huge influence on me and the morals that I developed and
                this was all because of the conflict between their ideas about
                life and the conflicts that arose in their relationship.
                <br /><br />
                My mother is a feminist and some sort of weird kind of hippie,
                that never lived the hippie lifestyle. She grew up religious but
                decided to distance herself from her religion due to the fact
                that she had pursued the career of being a medical doctor.
                Science kind of became her religion. But if you ask her what she
                believes in now, she would probably say she is a Buddhist or
                give you an answer
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                like, “Karma”, followed by, “What goes around comes around”.
                <br /><br />
                She had a hard upbringing and grew up in a township in Durban
                called Wentworth. It was a tough existence. Her family only had
                enough money to buy herself and her sister one pair of shoes
                every year and for part of her primary school years, her
                classroom was situated under a tree. Her father was an
                alcoholic, who had a violent and cold exterior towards his
                children. He died from alcohol related illness when my mother
                was 16 years old.<br /><br />
                Being a woman of colour was also something that shaped her.
                During her days at university, she participated in the struggle,
                by being part of an ANC cell as well as joining the United
                Democratic Front. This meant that protesting and facing police
                was something that was very much part of her life in her younger
                years. She believed in fighting for what was right.

            <div>
              <p>
                Something else that shaped her, was the marriage she had with my
                father. It was a difficult marriage riddled with alcoholism,
                drugs, and abuse. But she always maintained a certain level of
                composure to the best of her ability, in order to protect myself
                and my sister, Nina. She always showed us what a woman was
                capable of. She is a strong, independent African woman. She made
                sure her children knew that. <br /><br />
                She is a strong, independent African woman. She made sure her

                <br /><br />
                My father, however, intelligent and creative, struggled with
                life. He still struggles. I have always heard that he was
                spoiled as a child. That he was always allowed his way. This
                meant that he always pushed the boundaries. Creating conflict
                wherever he went. But he was an artist and this is what artists
                do. Whether he was a successful artist is a philosophical
                question that I cannot answer. Artists don’t need to be known to
                the world to have achieved their purpose in life. Their lives
                are art. Even if those lives were lived to create pain and
                sadness to those around them.
                <br /><br />

                He also grew up in a religious home, but in adulthood, he
                experimented with drugs and drank copious amounts of alcohol. He
                was a hippie who lived the hippie lifestyle.<br /><br />
                So he abandoned his religious upbringing and held a lot of
                animosity towards it and became a raging atheist. You know that
                saying, “God helps people who help themselves”? Well he firmly
                believed that, “People who help people help themselves”. I also
                believe this but I believe that there is a higher power out
                there. Things don’t just exist. There is always a reason.
                <br /><br />
                To be quite honest, I don’t know much else about my father. He
                was not present in my life as a parent. Rather as a negative
                entity that somehow never let me live and be myself and I grew
                up parenting him to a certain degree. I was always used as a
                gateway to get to my mother. I was always compared to her as
                well, while my mother compared me to him.

              <p>
                If I look back at what I experienced when I was his daughter, I
                see a lot of similarities between the way his life went and the
                way my life started to conspire. I think that there must have
                been some kind of trauma that he experienced when he was a child
                because nobody just chooses to escape reality for no reason.
                <br /><br />“People aren’t addicted to drugs and alcohol. They
                are addicted to escaping reality.” <br /><br />Now why did I
                choose to escape reality?

                At first it was because I wanted to fit in with everyone. Then
                it was because I wanted to be close to my higher power. To the
                universal energy. To my community. Then it was because I needed
                to escape to survive <br />But I really didn’t need to escape
                anymore. <br />
                When I went to rehab, I was at an all time low. <br />
                I never knew that rock bottom had a basement. 2019 was a year
                that I would pull up my socks and be the over-achiever that I
                knew I was. <br /><br />I had enrolled myself back into college,
                found myself a place to live, got myself a weekend job and got
                rid of my boyfriend who was pulling me down. I also found myself
                some new friends and even a guy that was happy with being in a
                non-committal relationship. Everything was going my way. I was
                keeping up with deadlines, working well and having tons of fun.
                I had this idea that I would work hard and play harder. And I
                would be a bad ass while doing it. But my demons crept in like
                they always did. Eventually I wasn’t having fun anymore.

                Eventually I became a miserable burned out mess who looked like
                shit and acted like an asshole. <br /><br />For a long time I
                accepted that I was an alcoholic and a drug addict. I love
                alcohol and I love drugs even more. Drugs showed me what my mind
                was capable of. It showed me what my demons were. How my demons
                made me who I was. Drugs helped me meet God. Drugs gave me
                confidence and creativity. They gave me sex appeal and mystery.
                <br /><br />But the truth that I had to come to terms with was
                the fact that I already had all these things without drugs.

                I was born at Green City Clinic in Eldorado Park Johannesburg on
                30 October 1994. My Mother is Rosemond Henry and my father, Glen
                du Plessis. When I was 2 years old, we moved to Ottery, Cape
                Town so that my father could obtain a diploma in graphic design
                and start his career. My mother was already working as a doctor
                who specialised in infectious diseases, in the public sector,
                dealing with HIV and TB. I would later find out that my mother
                had paid for my father’s education and for him to start his
                business. <br /><br />I was a daddy’s girl. He was everything to
                me and I was everything to him. We would watch Star Trek
                together and constantly draw and paint. He taught me how to do
                art and through him, I learned about animals and about God. He
                taught me what sex was and what consent was. He also taught me
                how to manipulate, how to lie and how charm. There was a dark
                side to him besides the fact that he had exposed myself and my
                sister to things that were way beyond our years.

                I was about 5 years old. My sister, Nina, had just been born
                about a couple months before on 24 March 1998. I did not
                understand it at the time but my father was a big drinker. The
                first memory of violence in my family occurred around this time.
                <br /><br />
                My mother took myself and my sister to the bedroom and held us
                between her legs while she sat with her back to my father. She
                was crying. My father was shouting and screaming in the
                background, banging cupboard doors and pacing.<br />
                I was not crying but rather reaching up to my mother’s face, to
                wipe away her tears, telling her, “Don’t cry mommy, don’t cry”.
                This was only the beginning…
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                We had lots of family friends. Braais on weekends were a regular
                thing at our home and myself and my sister were often present.
                Family friends came with playmates for us and through this,
                myself and my sister were able to form our first childhood
                bonds. But once all the festivities were done, I would witness
                my father rolling around on the floor, either shouting or
                crying, blind drunk. I didn’t know that he was drunk though. To
                be quite honest I don’t know what I thought at the time.
                <br /><br />During the week, my mother had to be on call at the
                hospital, and my grandmother had to look after myself and my
                sister, because my father would always be out of the house. I
                never knew where he was, but looking back now, I can only assume
                he was partying. Later, my mother would find out he was
                prostituting himself and had never started his business at all.
                She never showed it but this hit her really hard. What would it
                be like to be married to someone you have supported for so long
                through paying for their education, as well as paying for their
                office space as well as all the office equipment, only to find
                out that they never went to work at all and that all the money
                they were bringing into the household was earned from them
                selling their bodies on the streets? I couldn’t even imagine the
                betrayal she felt.

                When I was around 6 or 7, my father got me ready for school and
                took me through. He had also fetched me and brought me home.
                This was unusual as my mother mainly did this. He took myself
                and my sister to their bedroom, where my mother was laying in
                bed. She had a black eye. He told me that she had hurt herself
                falling off of a chair trying to get something from a high
                cupboard. For a long time, I had believed that lie. Even after
                my parents had separated.
                <br /><br />Not long after that incident, once her bruise had
                healed, my mother fetched me from school, my sister from day
                care and we drove to what I remember now as Atlantis. We stayed
                in a chalet for the weekend with nothing but the clothes on our
                backs and two small blankets. I cannot remember correctly, but I
                think that we then drove to Johannesburg to visit my mother’s
                best friend and my Godmother. I didn’t know this at the time but
                we were escaping.

                When we went back home, suddenly all our things were being
                packed up. We were moving to Lansdowne and my father was not
                included. I remember being taken to court, to speak to
                psychologists or social workers. They asked me weird questions
                about my parents but the only thing that I was concerned about
                was the fact that they didn’t take me swimming as often as I’d
                liked. I didn’t realise this was my parents divorce. If I had
                known, and if I had understood what it all meant, my answers to
                those questions would have been a whole lot different.
                <br /><br />The court had ruled that my father would be able to
                see us every second weekend, and every second school holiday. My
                mother, at first, was very lenient about this and told him that
                he could see us whenever he had liked. For the first few months,
                there weren’t many problems. But the alcohol was always present.
                And eventually things started getting out of control. My father
                would show up at our house in the middle of the night during the
                week, completely drunk, wanting to see us. So my mother laid
                down firmer boundaries.

                That same year, something had happened to me that would affect
                my life forever. In my grandparents room, there was an extra
                bed, where myself and my sister used to sleep when my father had
                us over for the weekend. They did not allow us to stay in the
                separate entrance with my father because he was always with
                friends drinking till late at night. I was sleeping on my back.
                It was the middle of the night and I had felt a hand go into my
                pants. I did not open my eyes, but I rolled over onto my stomach
                and pretended to still be asleep. But really my heart was in my
                stomach and I did not understand what was happening. I didn’t
                realise I had just been molested. I thought it was a weird
                dream. My sister was sleeping beside me and my extremely ill
                grandmother slept in my grandparents bed. My grandfather was the
                offender. I put that experience out of my head for a couple of
                years but that was not the only time that it had happened.

                The first school I had attended was Ferndale Primary in Ottery.
                I was there from grade R till Grade 2. I was an extremely
                creative child, and found pleasure in creating my own books
                filled with short stories and my own drawings. I would take them
                to school and show my friends. This would then get the attention
                of my teachers which resulted in me winning merit awards. I had
                even influenced some of the children in my class to start
                creating their own books and for a few weeks, it was the latest
                trend. It felt good to be followed. But I left that school when
                my parents divorced. This was when we moved to Lansdowne. I then
                attended Sunlands primary. <br />
                I was taken away from my comfort zone and my friends and I
                became very isolated. I was now shy and insecure and thrown into
                a new school where everybody had already solidified their
                friendship groups. I always attached myself to one person, and
                eventually, they would get tired of me and tell me they didn’t
                want to be friends with me anymore. I was always teased. I had
                skew teeth, big ears and I was the tallest girl in my grade. I
                didn’t know how to do my hair and had no sense of style. I
                stayed at this school till the end of grade 5.

                We left Lansdowne and moved to Plumstead, where I then attended
                John Graham Primary. In grade 6. I had a massive loser complex.
                I virtually had no friends. I spent most of that year sitting
                alone or staying in class during breaks to finish homework or
                draw. When I got to grade 7, I thought to myself, “This is it! I
                will become popular”. I was tired of being the loner. So I
                started putting myself out there. I started caring about my
                appearance. Every Sunday, I would blow dry and straighten my
                hair, and I had made friends with the most popular girl in
                school. <br /><br />Every Friday, we were allowed to wear casual
                clothes and I made sure I was part of the fashion parade. This
                was when I started being sexualised by the boys in my school.

                This was also the year that I had been molested for the second
                time. It was the same situation as the first, except by now, my
                grandmother had died and my father had left Cape Town to live in
                Johannesburg. So myself and my sister were left alone in the
                house with my grandfather. Because I was 13 years old, I now
                knew the first time was not a dream. After this incident. I did
                not want to see him again but I could not tell my mother. I did
                not have the courage. So myself and my sister continued to see
                him now and then. He would often make weird jokes, especially
                when we were out in public, telling people he knew that I was
                his girlfriend. I was never comfortable around him. <br />
                <br />
                In 2007, I started high school at Wynberg Girls’. I wasted no
                time identifying who the popular girls were and I made friends
                with them immediately. But I was still teased. I was still the
                loser. I don’t know if it was because I was just so desperate to
                be liked or if I was just awkward and insecure but there was
                never a day where I didn’t know my place, which was at the
                bottom of the hierarchy.

                That same year, my father came back to Cape Town. He looked
                healthier. We went to my aunt’s house in Goodwood. Before we got
                there, we dropped my grandfather off at Grandwest casino. He had
                always been a big Gambler, and would compile spreadsheets and
                spreadsheets filled with lotto ticket numbers in a desperate
                attempt to “crack the system”, and gamble regularly at the
                casino. While he was there, we spent the whole day braaing,
                playing pool and listening to music. I hung out with my cousins,
                my sister and my father. For a good portion of the day, I was
                having fun and so was Nina, but when it got to about 9pm, I
                could see nothing had changed. My father was still a drunk. It
                was now 12am and I wanted to go home.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Nina was 8 years old at the time. My father got into the car, so
                did his girlfriend (who I later found out was actually a
                prostitute) and my sister. I refused. He could barely speak, yet
                thought it was okay to drive us all the way back home. My sister
                was in the backseat of the car crying. My father shouted at me
                as I stood in the driveway, “Cleo!! Get in the fucking car
                now!!”. I was also crying but ignoring my father. I was instead
                shouting at my sister to get out of the car. That night, we
                stayed at my aunt’s house and they called my grandfather a cab.
                The next day, my grandfather drove us back home. After that, I
                didn’t see my father for another 2 years. <br /><br />
                I got drunk for the first time the next year. I was 14. It was
                not my first encounter with alcohol. My parents allowed me to
                have a glass on special occasions such as Christmas and New
                Years from as young as 2 years old. I also remember I had fallen
                once and cut the inside of my lip on some rocks, when I was 8 or
                9 years old and my father’s remedy was to give me a sip of his
                whisky to disinfect the wound.

                Having an alcoholic as a parent meant that you were always
                involved in the party. But I had never ever felt the effects of
                alcohol properly. Anyways, myself and my 5 friends gathered what
                money our parents’ gave us and bought a bottle of Wellingtons
                and a bottle of Zappa. One of my friends volunteered his house.
                We ordered pizza, hired movies and started drinking. But we were
                not drinking for fun.. We were drinking to get drunk. We took
                shot after shot of Zappa until the bottle was finished. Then we
                started drinking the Wellingtons with coke. All I remember was
                laughing uncontrollably, then army crawling to the bathroom to
                throw up. I then spent the whole of the next day dying in bed
                and throwing up some more. <br /><br />This was the beginning of
                my alcoholism.

                Every weekend for the next 4 years was spent “braaing” with
                friends at houses where parents didn’t care. The goal was always
                to get completely wasted. Throughout this time, the relationship
                I had with my mother deteriorated. We never got along before
                because I was always rebellious. She wanted nothing more to do
                with it, so she stopped giving me money and stopped agreeing to
                give me lifts. So I got my first weekend job doing promotions
                for Glamour Magazine, and this funded my new habits.
                <br /><br />It was one braai after the next. One House party
                after another. It was simple. I also started getting a
                reputation of being easy because I would always end up making
                out with some dude by the end of the night, and my friends
                started getting irritated by this. When I was 11, my mother had
                met a man named Nico Cloete, and by now she had married him. She
                is still with him currently. This was the other reason for the
                deterioration in our relationship.

                He is a wealthy man and I felt like he had become my father’s
                replacement. It also felt as if, like all the other boyfriends
                my mother had, he was buying my affection. I didn’t like him for
                years. I was totally ungrateful. He was paying for my education
                and I had barely had a conversation with him.
                <br /><br />Throughout high school, my father would slip in and
                out. When I was in grade 11, he showed up at my mother’s house,
                looking emaciated. He was high. He said he had lost the weight
                walking. This was 2010. At the end of that year, I got my first
                boyfriend, Waide. After the first 3 months, he broke up with me,
                because I was “too much”. But 3 months later, we got back
                together and stayed together for 2 years. This relationship was
                extremely unhealthy. All we did was drink, and go to clubs and
                have sex. He would accuse me of cheating on him and I would
                verbally abuse him. After the first year, he choked me in a
                drunken rage. We broke up again for a month. On the night of my
                matric ball, he showed up at the after party. We got drunk
                together and then we were back together again for another year.

            <div>
              <p>
                During that year, despite being constantly hungover on Mondays
                from a weekend of drinking, I worked hard. I managed to complete
                my portfolio and got into the Michaelis School of Fine Art,
                despite the fact that I did not do art as a subject during high
                school. It was a huge achievement and affirmed my ability.
                <br /><br />By the time I started University, Waide had dropped
                out after his first year. He was sitting at home with no
                direction, and had suddenly come up with the idea that he was
                going to join the army. By May of 2012, he had hit me twice and
                I decided to end the relationship. I was emasculating him by
                moving forward with my education and he was getting more and
                more depressed. All my money at the time was also going towards
                our drinking and he was taking advantage of me. He had tried to
                commit suicide after our break up and his family proceeded to
                blame me for it. This affected me greatly, as now I was alone
                and I was also the bad guy.
              </p>

            <div>
              <p>
                I did well in the first semester, despite my break up and
                constant drinking. To get over that relationship, I dyed my hair
                blonde and started clubbing. It was then that I realised the
                extent at which the guys in my network of friends had spoken
                about me and wanted me. So I learned how to use my looks and
                words to manipulate them into buying me alcohol and giving me
                rides. I started sleeping around. This would get me a ride to a
                party and drinks for the night, as well as a place to sleep for
                the next day while I recovered. It also got me weed, and food.
                <br /><br />Then I discovered Trance. <br /><br />My first
                trance party was at Side Show in Town. I had been speaking to a
                guy named Jesse and he invited me.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                He picked me up from my house in Plumstead. There were two other
                guys in the car. One of them looked at me and said, “Heeeey,
                it’s you.” I had no idea who he was but he knew me. He made a
                comment that implied I was just like other girls and I would
                only be around for the night but little did he know that I had
                other plans. See, when I see a guy that I like, and that I know
                will do whatever I want, I keep them around. And sex was my
                tool. We drank in the car on the way to the club, and when we
                got there, I asked Jesse to buy me MDMA. A couple weeks later, I
                went with him to Earthdance, which was my first outdoor
                festival. The was where I was raped for the first time. I was
                sleeping in the tent and he forced himself into me. I did not do
                anything because I didn’t want to make a scene.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                I smoked a lot of weed, drank a lot, took mescaline, MDMA and
                shrooms. My whole perspective on life had changed. My mind was
                altered. I started dreading my hair, stretching my ears,
                changing my style to suit my new lifestyle. I traded in my
                tight, cleavage bearing tops and tight jeans for flowy dresses,
                pants and floral. I also didn’t wear shoes. Suddenly I was
                decorated in beads and crystals and said love and light as a
                greeting. In the present day, I call this the crystal madness.
                <br /><br />Meanwhile, my quality of work at Michaelis was
                slipping. Jesse was still a constant, but now I needed someone
                else when Jesse was unavailable. So I made friends with a guy
                named Dwayne. A sweet guy. To control him, all I needed to do
                was give him my attention. Whatever I wanted, he would do. He
                would be the guy that would buy me cocaine and drive me all over
                Cape Town for the rest of the year. By the end of 2012, I had
                stopped going to class, and producing art, and I was using
                cocaine every 3rd day or so.

                Just before Christmas, I had a huge argument with my mother. By
                this time I had told her that I was dropping out and she was not
                happy with the amount of times I was going out during the week.
                I then called my friend, Dwayne, to fetch me and we went out
                partying in town. We took shrooms. I made 3 mistakes that night.
                I was drunk, with people I didn’t know and in town. The 2 grams
                of shrooms kicked in at a petrol station where we were snorting
                lines of MDMA off the back of a cd. After what seemed like
                hours, I started panicking. The trip was not ending. I blacked
                out, and later woke up in a locked car, alone in the dark. My
                friend finally came back to the car and I begged him to fetch my
                stuff and drive me home. I blacked out again and then woke up to
                the car parked under a bridge on the M5. He was sleeping in the
                front seat. I woke him up and begged him to drive me home but he
                said that he couldn’t because there was no petrol. This was a
                lie.

                I was in a nightmare and the only way I thought I could wake up
                from it was by killing myself. So I emptied my handbag, grabbed
                my metal nail file, and started stabbing my wrist. My friend
                freaked out and started speeding to my house. I ran inside
                screaming for help. My mother didn’t know what was going on or
                what to do. I was completely psychotic. It was 5am. I had woken
                up the whole house. I ran into my mother’s room, jumped into her
                bath and started spraying myself with water. My arm covered in
                blood. I ran to my room naked and put on clothes. She got me to
                my bed. I was rocking and crying and spilling all my demons.
                This was when she had found out about the sexual abuse. I was
                19. The next day, she called my grandfather and he blatantly
                denied it. <br /><br />In 2013, I got a job as a sales assistant
                at SKA Clothing in Long Street. I continued to go to trance
                parties, but my drinking seemed to lessen, but I was still
                having a drink after work every day. My drug habit however, sky
                rocketed. Every weekend that there was a festival happening, I
                was taking acid, MDMA and cocaine.

                By the end of that year, I quit my job at the clothing store and
                I had gotten my first bartending job at Chilli Bar. That’s when
                I started raking in cash. This was where my ability to
                manipulate men was really put to use and I found that the more I
                drank on the job, the better at it I was. So I was coming home
                from work drunk every night. During the months that I worked at
                Chilli Bar, I was raped for the second time by a guy I thought
                was my friend. It was basically the same situation as before.
                <br /><br />
                I would work Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I would make about
                R3000, give or take, and when I got home on a Sunday morning
                after a 12 hour shift, at 5am, I would rush into my house, get
                changed, and by 6am, there would be somebody waiting for me
                outside my house to take me to a trance festival, where I would
                drop acid and MDMA and drink copious amounts of alcohol and
                proceed to dance for about 9 hours straight.

                In 2014, I had started my first year at Vega, studying a BA in
                Brand Building and Management. I also quit my job and decided to
                start working for Liquid Rainbow. The main bar company that
                services Trance festivals. My priority at the time was not
                focused on my education, but rather to get in with the
                organisers at parties and become apart of the trance family.
                Working as a bartender there, got me free tickets, VIP camping
                spots and the privilege of meeting thousands of people. My
                network suddenly exploded. <br /><br />
                During that year, I had gotten a hold of myself and somehow
                managed to do quite well at university while keeping up with my
                trancing on the weekends. I progressed to second year but the
                drinking and drugging started to take its toll. By midyear, it
                had gotten so bad, that I would be sitting in my room snorting
                cocaine, while my mother stood outside my bedroom window
                watering the garden.

                One evening after partying for 24 hours straight, I came home,
                and after about 3hours, I started having a panic attack. I was
                in tachycardia, due to withdrawal. My mother gave me an
                anti-psychotic and monitored me through the night. The next day,
                She took me for a drug test, and drove me to the station and
                forced me to go to college. I lied and said I was spiked. But I
                knew she knew that was lie. I lost all my friends that day. My
                mother found out about the drugs and called their parents.
                <br /><br />
                By the end of that year I had dropped out of college because I
                was depressed and my mother kicked me out of her house. I
                reminded her too much of my father and she could not deal with
                that again. The one friend I was able to keep was Cera. I had
                met her in the beginning of 2015. She had helped me stop the
                drugs and lessen my drinking, but I soon started smoking weed
                every day.

                In 2016, Our friendship became extremely co-dependent. We spent
                nearly every single day together. If I went on a date, then I
                would go to her house straight after. She would also set me up
                on dates. Her house was my second home. I kept her secrets about
                her cutting and she kept my secrets about starving myself. We
                starved together. When she tried to kill herself, I was there
                the next day to help her. When I was in a panic attack, she
                would give me anxiety medication because I couldn’t call my mom.
                We raised a dog together. We were going to move in together. My
                mother even thought I was gay and that I was in a relationship
                with her because of how much we would fight. But we were
                basically in a relationship. We just didn’t have sex. We were
                even in a major car accident together.

                The same year, I got a job as a trainee editor for What’s on in
                Cape Town. My routine everyday was; wake up at 6am, smoke a
                cigarette, smoke 5 bongs, get dressed, smoke another 2, go to
                work. I worked well. Or at least I thought I did. Being a
                creative was easy. I’ve been writing since I was a child. And I
                thought weed made it better. But actually it was just making my
                depression worse. When I got home, I would smoke 5 bongs
                immediately, look for something to watch on my laptop, roll a
                joint, smoke that and then proceed to smoke a bong every hour
                until I fell asleep. As the year went by, it became harder and
                harder for me to get out of bed in the morning. I was replacing
                all my meals with bongs, and sleeping all day for weeks. The
                little money I had was spent on weed. I couldn’t afford food. I
                went from 66kg to 49kg in 6months.

            <div>
              <p>
                On the weekends, I would go to Decodance nightclub with Cera.
                She was a bartender there. I used to be the club photographer on
                the weekends I didn’t have bartending gigs, but I decided I
                preferred drinking there instead so I promoted myself to a
                customer. But because I had previously worked there, naturally
                everything was free. I would also use my skills to get men to by
                me drinks.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                I would stand in the middle of the bar, leaning on it, while
                smoking a cigarette. Back facing the bartenders. Within in 2
                minutes, some poor soul would strike up conversation with me and
                that was it. He was mine for the night. By the end of 2016, I
                had lost my best friend. She could no longer take my
                co-dependency, drinking and my constant depression and anxiety
                issues. Not to mention the fact that I had also picked up
                cocaine again. I had also slept with someone she was previously
                involved with and crashed her car driving drunk. She had enough.
                <br /><br />Then I met Warren. By now I had quit my job in
                editing and I was unemployed. I was invited to a braai in
                Stellenbosch, (Funny how everything significant that happened in
                my life was always surrounded around some braai). Anyway, we
                instantly clicked and I ended up spending 3 days with him in a
                non-stop conversation. He was the first guy that did not want to
                just jump into my pants straight away. I thought to myself, this
                is the one. He was studying a BSC in Biodiversity and Ecology at
                Stellenbosch University.

                For the first year, we did semi-long distance. I had gotten a
                job as a modelling agent for My Booker, so I worked in the week
                and then went to Stellenbosch on the weekends to see him. Every
                day after work, I would go to fat cactus and drink 3 double
                margaritas and 3 shots of tequila at least, before going home.
                On the weekends, in Stellenbosch, I would buy 2 bottles of wine
                as well as drink at Mystics, and smoke weed constantly. Warren
                also lived with his dealer. I earned a good salary and his
                mother was giving him R1500 per week. But Warren was so
                dependent on weed, that I also had to fund him. He failed that
                year. Something I realised later on was that he had also
                sexually coerced me several times during that year.
                <br /><br />Anyway, I told him, “Take a break. Come live with me
                in Cape Town, and get a job. Get some life experience.” For the
                first 6 months of 2018, he was miserable. He quit every job he
                had after 2 weeks, smoked weed and played games constantly
                throughout the day while I was at work. He constantly judged me
                on my drinking, even though I was funding our whole lives. June
                of 2018, I quit my Job, because he wanted to move to Durban for
                the rest of the year, and live with his mother. On that Journey,
                at every backpackers we stopped at, I got blackout drunk. I
                didn’t want to go and if I had let him leave without me, I felt
                like I was being abandoned.

            <div>
              <p>
                When we got to Durban, we both got bartending jobs but he became
                extremely controlling over my drinking. I had a couple of drinks
                whenever there was an opportunity and compensated with weed. His
                dependence on that substance allowed me to fill my void. But I
                watched him slip more and more into gaming addiction and
                marijuana dependency during those last 5 months. His mother
                enabled him and judged me. I was alone and isolated in a land
                full of mansions and toy dogs. So in November, I came back to
                Cape Town alone.

            <div>
              <p>
                Something important for me to mention here, is that between the
                period of 2013 and 2018, while I was dealing with all the above
                mentioned, I was also still dealing with my father. He had been
                diagnosed with bipolar, never treated it and continued to drink
                and do drugs. To this day, he has never believed that his father
                had sexually abused me. He believes that it was a memory
                implanted by my mother. That I was brainwashed or a liar. I have
                received countless Facebook messages, SMSs and voicemails sent
                from him in a drunken delusion, calling me a “bitch”, and a
                “poes”. Telling me that I am dead to him while at the same time
                telling me how much he loves me and misses me. Last year, I
                finally cut off all contact.

              <p>
                My mother provided what little emotional support she could. Our
                relationship has always been rocky because of my failures to
                deliver and because of all her money I have wasted. So all I
                have done is try to find emotional support through drinking and
                taking drugs. For the last couple of years, at least once a day,
                I thought of dying. What keeps me going is the fact that it is
                not only selfish, but I have enormous potential.
                <br /><br />Before I left Durban, I had done a Neuro-psych test
                and got an IQ score of 118, which is above average. I have a
                splinter skill in conceptual thinking. I am a visionary and
                photorealistic artist. I am a writer. I have so much to offer
                the world and myself. The last few months have been torture.
                Knowing all of the above has motivated me to go to university
                and finish my branding degree, but after years of drowning in
                alcohol, I was struggling to get back to the surface.

                Since November, I have drank at least 10 tequilas and 6 beers
                every day. I don’t know how I have been able to keep up with
                college deadlines. I also went back to cocaine. Worse than ever.
                Because now I was buying my own bags. And that was a substance I
                thought I was done with. This year I was supposed to sort my
                life out. Be more independent and self-sustaining. And I felt
                like I was doing that in the beginning. I had never missed a
                single shift at work and I had attended 90% of all my classes
                for the semester. I met a nice man who seems to care about me
                enough to allow me my space and freedom to do what I want. I
                made new friends who provided me with support, both emotionally
                and financially, if I was in a bad spot by the end of the month.
                But deep down inside I knew that I was still drowning.

                The Monday before I admitted myself to Crescent Clinic, I had
                gone on a bender. I got blackout drunk, bought a bag of cocaine,
                spent R2600 on god knows what and somehow messed up the
                ligaments in my knee, which has now thrown out my lower back. I
                had also invited some random guy to my house to have sex with
                me. When I woke up the next morning, I was mortified by the
                messages I found but I was also grateful that he had declined,
                because I am actually involved with someone and it is not in my
                moral code to sleep with a person while sleeping with another.

                I was in pain both physically and mentally, and caught myself

                anything. That was when I decided it was time to get help.

                father had been arrested and institutionalized for going
                psychotic. <br />This is dramatic irony at its best.
                <br />Father and daughter. <br />Both alcoholics and addicts.
                <br />Both institutionalised. <br />Him, because he has finally
                died inside, and me, because I am finally about to start living.

                When I was in rehab, I realised a lot of things about my life.
                Like the fact that I was absolutely insane before I went in and
                that I had made my life completely unmanageable. I realised that
                I was lying to myself by thinking that I had control over the
                chaos I loved so much. Before I went in, I had always tried to
                do everything on my own. I thought I was a badass. But now I see
                that I was actually just slowly killing myself.
                <br /><br />Being sober definitely comes with its challenges.
                Now I suddenly have an eating disorder that needs to be dealt
                with. Now that I don’t have the substances to escape, I have to
                live life on life’s terms. Even though my mind is now clear, I
                am also bombarded by constant thought and emotion. I actually
                have to feel what I am feeling. I am not allowed to escape any
                more. But there is still that constant compulsion to use and
                facing that is probably the most difficult thing of all.

                Its like having your “Fuck it” switch 1mm away from your finger
                tip. Your hand wants to move and just hit the switch but your
                other hand is holding it back. Constantly. Every day, I fight
                this battle with myself. <br /><br />But I have never felt
                better. <br /><br />Now it’s time to pick up the pieces.
